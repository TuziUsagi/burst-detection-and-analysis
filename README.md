# burstAnalysis

Identify burst activities by neuron spike train. Use ISI scatter plot and histogram to determine if a neuron is a bursting neuron. 
Run PlotBursts to see the culmulative distribution of burst duration, # of spikes in the burst, firing rate in the burst, and interburst intervals.

Function findbursts and bursts are called by PlotBursts.

Example spike time data come from targeted extracellular recording of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons from diestrous and estrous mouse.
